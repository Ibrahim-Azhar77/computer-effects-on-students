        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Information Access</h3>
            <p>Computers give students quick and easy access to a world of information. With just a few clicks, they can find answers to their questions and learn new topics. This helps them study smarter and stay updated with the latest knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Research Skills</h3>
            <p><a href="http://computerguide.infinityfreeapp.com/index.html?i=2" target="_blank"> Computers help students </a> improve their research skills by allowing them to explore various sources online. They learn how to find reliable information, compare facts, and think critically. This builds a strong foundation for academic and real-world learning.</p>

            <h3>Interactive Learning</h3>
            <p>With the help of videos, quizzes, and educational games, computers make learning more engaging. Students can interact with lessons instead of just reading from books. This keeps them interested and helps them understand topics better.</p>

            <h3>Digital Literacy</h3>
            <p>Using computers regularly teaches students how to work with digital tools and software. They learn typing, online communication, and basic tech skills. These abilities are important for both schoolwork and future careers.</p>

            <h3>Online Education</h3>
            <p>Computers allow students to attend classes from anywhere through the internet. They can join virtual classrooms, watch recorded lectures, and submit assignments online. This makes education more flexible and accessible for everyone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Negative Effects of Computers on Students</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>While computers help students in many ways, they also have some downsides. Too much screen time and overuse can affect both health and learning habits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye Strain</li>
                <li>Game Addiction</li>
                <li>Physical Inactivity</li>
                <li>Poor Writing</li>
                <li>Distractions Online</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Eye Strain</h3>
            <p>Using a computer for long hours can strain students' eyes, making them feel tired and uncomfortable. Common issues include dry eyes, blurry vision, and frequent headaches. To avoid this, it's helpful to take short breaks and ensure the screen area is well-lit.</p>

            <h3>Game Addiction</h3>
            <p>Spending too much time playing computer games can make students addicted. It often distracts them from studies and reduces their focus on learning. Over time, this habit can harm their academic performance and time management.</p>

            <h3>Physical Inactivity</h3>
            <p>Using <a href="https://1752517445630-computer-guide.surge.sh/" target="_blank"> computers </a> for long hours can lead to less physical movement. Students may sit for too long, which is unhealthy for their body. Lack of exercise can cause weight gain and other health issues.</p>

            <h3>Poor Writing</h3>
            <p>Relying on computers for writing can weaken students’ handwriting and spelling skills. Auto-correct features often stop them from learning correct grammar. This may affect their basic writing abilities over time.</p>

            <h3>Distractions Online</h3>
            <p>While studying on computers, students can easily get distracted by games, videos, or social media. These distractions reduce their study time and affect concentration. It becomes harder for them to stay focused on learning tasks.</p>
