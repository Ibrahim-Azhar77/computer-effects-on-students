        <h2>Evolution of Technology in Education</h2>
        <p>The journey of technology in education began decades ago when computers first entered classrooms in the late 20th century. Initially used for basic typing and programming lessons, they slowly became valuable teaching aids.</p>
        <p>Over time, traditional learning tools like chalkboards and printed books started shifting to digital formats—smartboards, eBooks, and educational software. This digital transition made learning more visual, interactive, and accessible.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has stepped into education. AI now powers personalized learning apps, smart grading systems, and even virtual tutors—bringing a major shift in how students learn and teachers teach.</p>
